# Host
`Hosts` are any device which sends or receive traffic over a network

There are 2 kind of hosts:
- `Client`: Initiate requests
- `Server`: Respond to requests

# IP Address
- An `IP Address` is the identity of each host

# Network
A `Network` is what transports traffic between `Hosts`
- Anytime two hosts are connected, you have a network.
- Is a logical grouping of hosts which require similar connectivity (Subnetworks, Subnets)

# Repeater
- A `Repeater` regenerates signals
  - Allow communications across greater distances

# Hub
- `Hubs` are simple multiport Repeaters
  - Everybody sees everybody else's data if they are connected to the same `Hub`.

# Bridge
- `Bridges` sit between Hub-connected hosts
  - Bridges only have two physical ports
  - Bridges learn which hosts are on each side
  - Avoid communications to send to all devices in a network, but will still send communications to all devices in a sub-network.

# Switch
- `Switches` are a combination of Hubs and Bridges
  - Multiple Physical Ports
  - Learns which hosts are on each port
  - Hosts on a Network share the same IP address space
  - Facilitate communication within a network
    - Network: Grouping of hosts which require similar connectivity

# Router
- `Routers` facilitate communication between networks
  - Provides a traffic control point (security, filtering, redirecting)
  - Nowadays, `Switches` can also perform filtering

- `Routers` learns which networks they are attached to.
  - The Interface `172.16.20.x` and `172.16.30.x` are both connected to the router
  - A `Router` has the knowledge of all the network interface it attaches to, which is known as a `Route Table`
  - Basically, A `Route Tables` is all the networks a `Router` knows about.

- A `Router` also has a `Gateway`, which is the `Host`'s way out of their local network
  - In order for any PC within the Interface `172.16.20.x` to communicate to the outer network, it has to go through the configured `Default Gateway`, which is the IP of the Router.

# Conclusion
There are many other Network Devices:
- Access Points
- Layer 3 Switches
- Firewalls
- IDS/IPS
- Load Balancers
- Proxies
- Virtual Switches (on the Cloud)
- Virtual Routers (on the Cloud)

All Network Devices either perform Routing or Switching Operations or both.
