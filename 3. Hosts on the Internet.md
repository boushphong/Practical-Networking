# Direct Connection
Both hosts have a NIC, and therefore a MAC address
Both hosts are configured with an IP address and a Subnet Mask
  - Subnet Mask identifies the size of the IP network
  - Subnetting is not covered in this lesson

Host A has some Data to send to Host B
Host A knows the IP address of Host B
- Maybe user typed: ping `10.1.1.33`
- Maybe IP address was acquired from DNS
- Host A knows `10.1.1.33` is in its own IP Network

## ARP

- ARP Mappings are stored in an ARP Cache

- Host B responds by sending an ARP Response
  - Response is sent Unicast (Directly to Host A)

- Host A populates it's ARP cache with Host B's IP/MAC mapping
- Host A now creates L2 header

- Data then will be sent to Host B. Host B will then discard the headers (L2 then L3). Data will then be processed by the application.

- Steps are the same regardless of if there are switches or hubs
- ARP links a L3 address to a L2 address.
