# Local Network Communication
Both hosts have a NIC, and therefore a MAC address
Both hosts are configured with an IP address and a Subnet Mask
  - Subnet Mask identifies the size of the IP network
  - Subnetting is not covered in this lesson

Host A has some Data to send to Host B
Host A knows the IP address of Host B
- Maybe user typed: ping `10.1.1.33`
- Maybe IP address was acquired from DNS
- Host A knows `10.1.1.33` is in its own IP Network

## ARP

- ARP Mappings are stored in an ARP Cache

- Host B responds by sending an ARP Response
  - Response is sent Unicast (Directly to Host A)

- Host A populates it's ARP cache with Host B's IP/MAC mapping
- Host A now creates L2 header

- Data then will be sent to Host B. Host B will then discard the headers (L2 then L3). Data will then be processed by the application.

- Steps are the same regardless of if there are switches or hubs
- ARP links a L3 address to a L2 address.

# Foreign Network Communication
Host A and C, and the Router have MAC and IP Addresses

Host A has some data to send to Host C
- Host A knows Host C's IP address
  - `/24` is a Subnet Mask - `255.255.255.0`
  - Provided by the User or the Application
- Host A knows Host C's IP address is on a foreign network by checking it's `Subnet Mask` and `IP Address`

- Host A creates an L3 header first since it knows the destination's IP address. Then Host A will proceed to create an L2 header. However, the next hop is the Router

- Host A uses ARP to resolve the MAC address of the Router's IP
  - The router IP address is configure as the `Default Gateway` on Host A either `Manually` or through `DHCP`

- The router wil then response to Host A

- Host A now would have all the information to populate it's ARP Cache and the Header for the package it wants to send from the Router's mapping information that Router have sent back to Host A

- Once the data is reached to the Router, router will discard the L2 Header and will take over from this point to do Hop to Hop (whether to multiple Router or to the Destination)\

**NOTE:** Since the first hop to the e5e5 router won't change, Host A can reuse it's ARP cache information of the e5e5 router to complete its package header without go through the process of sending an ARP request to broadcast message to all devices on the network, asking for the MAC address of the router that has the IP address of the default gateway.

After the initial discovery process, the host will use the MAC address of the router that it has already learned, until the cache entry expires or is manually removed.
