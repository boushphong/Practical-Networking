- MAC address table starts off empty, and as data is flowing through the topology, the switch will populate it's MAC address table

 - Switches only perform three actions
  - Learn
  - Flood
  - Forward

Once the switches flood the first package to all the devices connected to the switch, the device with the correct destination `d4d4` will send back the response to Host A.
- The data being sent back will trigger the switch to `learn` again and also populate it's MAC address table.

- Now the switch knows how to deliver the package from `d4d4` to `a1a1` since it has `a1a1`'s MAC Address in it's Mac Address Table. This is the `forward` operation
- Now the 2 hosts `d4d4` and `a1a1` can send package directly to each others (Still going through the switch without all 3 above operations)

# Host to Router through Switch Communication
The communication would be the same if `d4d4` was a router instead of a Host. The switch will still not look at the `Layer 3` header since it only care about `Layer 2` header.

# Host to Switch Communication
However, if a switch is configured to receive messages like a Host, then it would need an `IP address` and a `MAC address`. Then if traffic is going to be sent to the switch, it will still have to follow all the host communication rule. However if traffic is sent through the switch, then IP and MAC of the switch is redundant.

# Unicast flooding vs Broadcasts
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59940078/233791548-c31d4021-f367-4df9-a51c-53ff2bc4b9c8.png)
- Unicast flooding occurs when a switch sends a unicast packet to all of its connected ports because it does not have an entry in its MAC address table for the destination MAC address. This can happen when a device has just been added to the network or when the switch's MAC address table is full. Unicast flooding can cause network congestion and can be a security risk, as it can allow an attacker to intercept traffic that is not intended for them.
- Broadcast flooding, on the other hand, occurs when a switch sends a broadcast packet to all of its connected ports. Broadcast packets are used to send information to all devices on a network segment, and they are typically used for network discovery, such as ARP requests, DHCP requests, or protocols like OSPF and RIP. Broadcast flooding can also cause network congestion, but it is a necessary part of network communication and is used in many networking protocols. The switch will act as a Host when performing this operation.
- In summary, unicast flooding is a result of a switch not having an entry in its MAC address table, while broadcast flooding is a normal part of network communication used for sending information to all devices on a network segment.

# Multiple Switches

- Assuming Host A knows the MAC address of Host B. This is going to be a Unicast message (No ARP involved)

- Learn

- Flood action from the `Blue` switch

- Continue from the `Green` switch

- Flood action from the `Green` switch

- Since Host B has the correct MAC address destination, it will not discard the message and will generate a response from Host B from host A

- When the response arrives on the `Green Switch`, the `Green switch` will be able to learn the MAC address on port 6

- `Green Switch` then will forward to port 4 which is the `Blue switch`

- Since the `Blue switch` has just received a message on port 3, it will learn the mapping for MAC address of `bbbb.bbbb.bbbb` for port 3

- Final Forward Step since `Blue switch` already had `aaaa.aaaa.aaaa` address on its MAC address table on port 1
