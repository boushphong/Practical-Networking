# Why does NAT exist?
There are only `2**32 = ~4.2 billion addresses` on the internet. And we are running out of IPv4 addresses ...

NAT helps us to provide IPs to the large number of devices in the world despite the consraint of 4.2 billion addresses available

## NAT
- Modify only Layer 3 header

## PAT
- Modify both Layer 3 and Layer 4 of the header

# Static vs Dynamic Translation
 
## Static

Once the packet reaches the router, the router will translate `10.6.6.61` to `72.9.4.11` in the L3 source header, and once the server responses with the destination header of `72.9.4.11`, it will translate to `10.6.6.61` and route packet to the device.

## Dynamic

In dynamic translation, the router will decide which device gets which IP.

## Static NAT

If there was another host inside `10.2.2.0/24` network, the host would have to have its own public address. We would have a seperate public address for every internal host that we want to create a **Static NAT** for. This technique however does not help to conserve public IP addresses, because each private IP address on the network must have a corresponding public IP address in the NAT mapping. In other words, each device on the private network that needs to access the Internet requires a unique public IP address in the NAT mapping, which can consume a large number of public IP addresses.

In Static NAT, We make internal resources externally accessible by IP Addresses.

## Static PAT
In Static PAT, We make internal resources externally accessible by Ports.

Benefits of PAT:
- Facilitates using Non-Standard Ports.
- Port Forwarding (Hole Punching)
- Bidirectional (Enable traffic flow from both directions **to the Internet** and **from the Internet**)
- Multiple servers can use one Public IP Address (Conserver IP Address)

Why was the source port re-randomized on the router's translation table?
- Assures each host has a unique IP:Port on the outside
- Ensures router can "un-translate" packet back to original host

### What if traffic was initiated by the Outside host?

If you must let traffic to flow from outbound to internal network?
- You must combine Dynamic PAT with Static PAT. In this case, you would have to manually add a mapping record in the Router's Translation Table. This practice is usually called **Hole Punching**.

## Dynamic NAT
NAT - Only changes IP addresses (mofifies the L3 header)
- Admin defines set of pre and post translation attributes
- Device determines actual post-translation IP Address
- Ports are not translated
  - Multiple devices cannot share IP addresses

Only three hosts has connection to the Internet. All three of them consume all public IP address

Once another host finishes its connection, the IP might be released so another Host could use the IP to connect to the Internet. However, now if Host A now wants to connect to the Internet, the packet would be dropped since all the Public IPs has been consumed

Dynamic NAT is rarely being used today. 

### Usecase (somewhat outdated)
- Bidirectional while connection is active
  - Useful for Protocols which require secondary, inbound connections to the Client
  - File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

### Disadvantages
- Non Deterministic IP assignments
- Inconsistent connectivity
