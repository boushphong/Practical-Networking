# Why does NAT exist?
There are only `2**32 = ~4.2 billion addresses` on the internet. And we are running out of IPv4 addresses ...

NAT helps us to provide IPs to the large number of devices in the world despite the consraint of 4.2 billion addresses available

## NAT
- Modify only Layer 3 header

## PAT
- Modify both Layer 3 and Layer 4 of the header

# Static vs Dynamic Translation
 
## Static

Once the packet reaches the router, the router will translate `10.6.6.61` to `72.9.4.11` in the L3 source header, and once the server responses with the destination header of `72.9.4.11`, it will translate to `10.6.6.61` and route packet to the device.

## Dynamic

In dynamic translation, the router will decide which device gets which IP.

## Static NAT

If there was another host inside `10.2.2.0/24` network, the host would have to have its own public address. We would have a seperate public address for every internal host that we want to create a **Static NAT** for. This technique however does not help to conserve public IP addresses, because each private IP address on the network must have a corresponding public IP address in the NAT mapping. In other words, each device on the private network that needs to access the Internet requires a unique public IP address in the NAT mapping, which can consume a large number of public IP addresses.
