# Subnetting
Subnetting is taking a network and dividing it into sub-networks

For example, A Network of `10.0.0.0/24` with 256 IP Addresses can be divided into 2 Sub-networks of `10.0.0.0/25` with 128 IP Addresses each, or 4 sub-metworks of `10.0.0.0/26` with 64 IP Addresses each ...
We also have the option to mix and match, eg. 1 sub-network of `10.0.0.0/25`, 2 sub-networks of `10.0.0.0/27` and 1 sub-network of `10.0.0.0/26`, which in total combines to 256 IP Addresses.

There are 7 attributes of Subnetting.
- Network ID: First IP address in each Sub-Network
- Broadcast IP: Last IP address in each Sub-Network. (A Special address in each subnet that allows users to speak to every other IP within the subnet, A User could talk to all other IPs by sending a packet to the Broadcast IP Address)
- First Host IP: IP address after the Network ID
- Last Host IP: IP address before the Broadcast IP
- Next Network: Network ID of the next Sub-Network
- IP Addresses: Number of IP Addresses in Sub-Network
- CIDR/Subnet: Converting between CIDR/Subnet Mask

**NOTE:** CIDR can be used to determined how many IP address a subnet have:
- CIDR = `10.0.0.0/24` means the octet will be (32 - 24 = 8 (1s)) `11111111` in binary, which translates to 256 IP addresses, which correspond to the subnet `255.255.255.0`.
- CIDR = `10.0.0.0/25` means the octet will be (32 - 25 = 7 (1s)) `1111111` in binary, which translates to 128 IP addresses, which correspond to the subnet `255.255.255.128`.
- CIDR = `10.0.0.0/27` means the octet will be (32 - 27 = 5 (1s)) `11111` in binary, which translates to 32 IP addresses, which correspond to the subnet `255.255.255.224`.

## Solving Subnetting Problem in the 4th octet

- Increment by the group size number until it is larger than the 4th octets of the IP. Then use the the number just smaller that the 4th octets of the IP as the Network ID.

Since the CIDR `213.50.111.222/2` block reside in the last block of `/2`. There is no next network
