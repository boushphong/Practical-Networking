## Foreground

As soon as you put data on the wire, you no longer have control to the data. It would be on the hands of ISPs (Routers ...) as it finally delivers to the the destination. Without the SSL/TLS, data sending through the internet is completely unencrypted and it is for everyone to see. Data like HTML pages are OK to be looked at? but what about information like bank information ...

# What is SSL/TLS?
- SSL/TLS create a **secure, protected** tunnel across the Internet
  - HTTPS - HTML transfered with HTTP protected by SSL
- SSL/TLS can also protect other data transfer
  - SSL VPN

**SSL** - Secure Sockets Layer, **TLS** - Transport Layer Security

## How do SSL/TLS protect your data
- Data sent acorss a wire can be captured by anyone in the middle.
- Purpose of SSL/TLS is to protect the data in three ways:
  - **Confidentiality**: Data is only accessible by Client and Server (**Encryption**)
  - **Integrity**: Data is not modified between Client and Server (**Hashing**)
  - **Authentication**: Client/Server are indeed who they say they are (**PKI - Public Key Infrastructure**)

## Anti-Replay and Non-Repudiation
- `Anti-Replay`: Anti-replay mechanisms aim to prevent the replay of captured or intercepted data to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of a communication session. This is particularly important in scenarios where an attacker may capture and later replay data packets to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious actions.
  - Provided with built-in sqquence numbers
  - Built-in **Integrity** + **Authentication** mechanism
Example: In a secure messaging protocol, anti-replay measures can be employed to ensure that a message can only be processed once. Each message could be assigned a unique sequence number or timestamp, and the recipient would only accept and process messages with new or valid sequence numbers, discarding any duplicates or messages from the past.

- `Non-Repudiation`: Non-repudiation is a security property that ensures that a party cannot deny the authenticity or integrity of a message or action. It provides evidence to prove that a specific entity sent a message, performed a transaction, or took a particular action, thereby preventing them from later denying their involvement.
  - Sender cannot later deny sending a message
  - Byproduct of **Integrity** + **Authentication**
Example: In a digital signature scheme, non-repudiation can be achieved by using a private key to sign a document or message. The signature can be verified using the corresponding public key, providing proof of the sender's identity and ensuring that the sender cannot later deny their participation or tampering with the content.

# Client, Server, Certificate Authority (CA) Roles
- Client
  - Entity initiating the TLS Handshake (Web Browser ...)
  - Optionally authenticated (rare)
- Server
  - Entity receiving the TLS Handshake (Webserver: Nginx ..., Load Balancer, SSL Accelerator ..)
  - Always authenticated
- Certificate Authority
  - Governing Entity that issues Certificates
  - Trusted by Client and Server
  - Provides Trust Ancchor
    - If we trust the CA, we trust what the CA trusts

A Certificate Authority (CA) is a trusted third-party organization that issues and manages digital certificates. A digital certificate is a digitally signed document that binds a public key to the identity of an entity, such as a **website**, **organization**, or **individual**. CAs play a crucial role in ensuring the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of online communications. A CA is responsible for verifying the identity of certificate applicants and issuing digital certificates to them. The CA's verification process typically involves validating the identity of the applicant through various means, such as verifying domain ownership, conducting background checks, or verifying legal documents.

Regarding ownership, a Certificate Authority can be owned and operated by different entities. It can be an independent commercial organization specializing in certificate issuance and management, such as Sectigo, DigiCert, or GlobalSign. Alternatively, a CA can also be owned and operated by governmental or regulatory bodies, such as national or regional government agencies, to ensure compliance and security in specific contexts. Regardless of ownership, the CA's primary role is to establish trust by issuing and managing digital certificates that are used for secure communication, encryption, and authentication on the internet.
