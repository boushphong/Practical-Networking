As soon as you put data on the wire, you no longer have control to the data. It would be on the hands of ISPs (Routers ...) as it finally delivers to the the destination. Without the SSL/TLS, data sending through the internet is completely unencrypted and it is for everyone to see. Data like HTML pages are OK to be looked at? but what about information like bank information ...

# What is SSL/TLS?
- SSL/TLS create a **secure, protected** tunnel across the Internet
  - HTTPS - HTML transfered with HTTP protected by SSL
- SSL/TLS can also protect other data transfer
  - SSL VPN

**SSL** - Secure Sockets Layer, **TLS** - Transport Layer Security

## How do SSL/TLS protect your data
- Data sent acorss a wire can be captured by anyone in the middle.
- Purpose of SSL/TLS is to protect the data in three ways:
  - Confidentiality: Data is only accessible by Client and Server (**Encryption**)
  - Integrity: Data is not modified between Client and Server (**Hashing**)
  - Authentication: Client/Server are indeed who they say they are (**PKI - Public Key Infrastructure**)
