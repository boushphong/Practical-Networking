Routers forward packets not destined to themselves. (Unlike Hosts, which drop packets that are not destined for themselves)

When Routers receive packets with an unknown Destination IP, packet will be dropped.
- In this case, since the R2 router doesn't know how to get to the `10.0.44.x/24` Network since it's not in R2's route table. The packet will be dropped
- If however, the packet was destined for the `10.0.55.x/24` or `10.0.66.x/24` Network, R2 will route the packet to the Host.
