Routers forward packets not destined to themselves. (Unlike Hosts, which drop packets that are not destined for themselves)

# Route Table - Directly Connected

When Routers receive packets with an unknown Destination IP, packet will be dropped.
- In this case, since the R2 router doesn't know how to get to the `10.0.44.x/24` Network since it's not in R2's route table. The packet will be dropped
- If however, the packet was destined for the `10.0.55.x/24` or `10.0.66.x/24` Network, R2 will route the packet to the Host.

# Route Table - Static Routes
The packet will be sent to R1 through the R2's right interface and then through the R1's IP address

However, in this case, if R1 doesn't have the `10.0.66.x/24` Network route when `a9a9` send its response back to `c7c7`, the message will be dropped. Hence it's important to set up all the addresses in route table correctly.

# Dynamic Routes - Knowledge sharing between routers
The content of the actual dynamic route is identical to what it was with a static route. The only difference is how it was learned 
- If an administrator logged into the router and manually told the router how to get to a particular network, that is a static route. 
- If the routers automatically talk to each other and told each other of the networks that they know about that is a dynamic route.

Dynamic Routing Protocols method that the routers will use to talk to each other to exchange these dynamic routes is governed by what's known as different dynamic routing protocols:
- RIP, OSPF, BGP, EIGRP, IS-IS ...

**NOTE:** The number of MAC addresses a router has depends on the number of network interface cards (NICs) it has. A typical consumer or small business router has at least two NICs, one for the WAN (Wide Area Network) interface, which is typically connected to a modem or the Internet, and one for the LAN (Local Area Network) interface, which is used to connect to devices on the local network.

Each NIC has a unique MAC address assigned to it, so a router with two NICs will have two MAC addresses. Some routers may have additional NICs for other purposes, such as a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone), which is used to separate and secure a portion of the local network, or for connecting to other networks or devices.
