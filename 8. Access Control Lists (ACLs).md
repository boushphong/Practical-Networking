# ACLs
The purpose of an access control list is to identify traffic. It's a tool on a Router (say `Cisco` to identify traffic).

You can apply an ACL to ...
- Interface
  - Matched traffic is permitted through
- NAT
  - Matched traffic is translated
- VPN
  - Matched traffic is encrypted and sent through tunnel.
- Route-map
  - Matched advertisements are accepted
- QoS
  - Matched traffic is prioritized (or de-prioritized)
- ...

## ACL on Interface

There are two types of ACLs
- Standard (Matches on source IP)
  - You can only allow access to the internet on either host `10.0.0.11`, `10.0.0.22` or both. (Complete Trust or Complete Distrust)
- Extended (Matches on Src IP, Dest IP, Src Port, Dest Port, Protocol)
  - You can create flexible access list entries (say allows host `10.0.0.11` to speak to host `54.4.4.7` but not `45.5.5.8`.)

Packet Filter ACL can be applied:

- Per Interface fa0/2, gig1/3, etc
  - The actual physical interface of a router (Router usually has two interfaces (one facing inside segment `LAN Interface`, one facing the internet `WAN Interface`)). There can be `Wireless Interface`, `Console Interface` ...
- Per Direction
  - In of the Interface or Out of the Interface
- Per IP Protocol
  - IPv4 or IPv6 (You can't have a single access list filtering both IPv4 and IPv6)
  - Specific protocols like (HTTPS, HTTP, SMTP ...) is usually not filtered by the the router. They are filtered on the application layer.
