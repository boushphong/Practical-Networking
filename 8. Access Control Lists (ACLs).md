# ACLs
The purpose of an access control list is to identify traffic. It's a tool on a Router (say `Cisco` to identify traffic).

You can apply an ACL to ...
- Interface
  - Matched traffic is permitted through
- NAT
  - Matched traffic is translated
- VPN
  - Matched traffic is encrypted and sent through tunnel.
- Route-map
  - Matched advertisements are accepted
- QoS
  - Matched traffic is prioritized (or de-prioritized)
- ...
